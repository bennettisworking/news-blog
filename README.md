# news-blog

Welcome to my simple news blog reader project. It is currently set up to cull Pink Floyd related articles from the NewsAPI and display them in blog form. 

Installation is really simple, just npm install and then run gulp to start the server.

Features a simple environment with jshint on the Gulp task runner to automatically test the script (at this stage I didn't think it needed any more rigorous testing).

News-blog uses Bootstap and is responsive and has a mobile, tablet and a desktop layout.

No prefab layout templates were used in this blog, all of it is hand coded.
